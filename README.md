# Learn C the Hard Way

I'm working my way through [Learn C the Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/) to learn a little bit about C.

## Notes

* Looks like variables are initialized to their zero values (at least `ints`, anyway).

### gcc

* `-Wall` output (nearly) all compiler errors
* `-g` produce debugging info in the OS's native format, e.g. for use with `gdb`
